# Apple Website Clone - iPhone 15 Pro

This project is a clone of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro website, built using modern web technologies to replicate the design, animations, and interactive elements. The goal was to enhance my frontend development skills and work with advanced libraries like Three.js and GSAP.

## 🚀 Features
- **Smooth Animations**: Implemented using GSAP for fluid transitions and scrolling effects.
- **3D Elements**: Leveraging Three.js to render interactive 3D models.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a seamless experience across all devices with Tailwind CSS.
- **High Performance**: Optimized rendering and animations for better user experience.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **React.js** - Component-based UI development
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics rendering
